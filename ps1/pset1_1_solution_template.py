### Be sure to write the Python code yourself!  We do run sophisticated automated  ###

### troubled each year when a few studentsturn in nearly identical programs, and   ###
### we have to administer appropriate consequences.  It is better to turn in a     ###
### statement that you didn't have time to complete the assignment than to turn in ###
### the same code as someone else.                                                 ###
